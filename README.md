# 2020_cotranslational_targeting
The MATLAB code has been tested in MATLAB 2017

The source code does not need to be installed and can be directly executed in MATLAB

The parameters used for the modeling result in the paper are included in the code itself or reported in the manuscript.

Length dependent Kd refers to Fig. S9a and Length dependent Kd 2 refers to Fig. S9d

After loading the code, follow the comment to change parameters as needed, run the code and plot the variabe "rnc(4,:)" to get the translocation probability vs nascent chain length.

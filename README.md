# 2020_cotranslational_targeting
The MATLAB code has been tested in MATLAB 2017

The source code does not need to be installed and can be directly executed in MATLAB

The parameters used for the modeling result in the paper are included in the code itself or reported in the manuscript.

After loading the code, follow the comment to change parameters as needed, run the code and plot the variabel "rnc(4,:)" to get the translocation probability vs nascent chain length.
